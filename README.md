# 42-minishell
A small-scale Linux shell program, intended to mimic the original BASH. Given as a mandatory common core project by 42 Schools.

# Objective
The task is to create a small but functioninng shell that mimics the behavior of the original Bourne Again SHell, created in 1986. This project is the first team project of the 42 cursus, and must be done by 2 students. The students should collaborate, communicate and build efficiently, and manage their time well.

# How Does BASH Work?
When first ran, BASH prints a prompt to the terminal screen and waits for the user to enter a command, seperated by newline characters. Once the input is filled, it parses the command into tokens, expands the required variables, and then executes the command.

In short:

Prompt > Parse Input > Tokenization > Expansion > Execution > Repeat
